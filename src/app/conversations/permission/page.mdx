## Permission 

By creating and modifying the permissions of the team members, you will be able to monitor which members of the team can have access to which information on erxes.

**With permission, you can do...**
Sometimes you don't want your entire team to have access to everything within erxes— that's why we've made it easy to give certain team members access to specific data and features in your erxes. In the team members section of your settings menu, you can edit the permissions of each team members. With permission, your organization can:
- have better data security
- prevent team members' destructed by too much-unrelated information
- ensure a more focused work-oriented environment.

** Creating the permissions
The Permission can be found in the settings section on the bottom left side of the screen. By selecting the tab, you will be able to access it. There will be default permission types as admin, marketing, sales, and support at erxes when you first join in. And you can create your permission by editing the existing permissions or creating brand new ones for your organization.

If you have a small team that everyone has to get access to everything, you may only create one permission, which has a superpower, and you could give everyone that permission.
