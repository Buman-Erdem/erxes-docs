## Ubuntu

# Installation on Ubuntu

The following documentation will guide you through the installation of an erxes project using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on [Ubuntu.](https://ubuntu.com/)

Docker is an open platform that allows to develop, ship and run applications by using containers (i.e. packages containing all the parts an application needs to function, such as libraries and dependencies).

# Preparing the installation

erxes installation requires at least four software prerequisites to be already installed on your computer:

<Caution>
    Erxes code takes approximately 12GB storage space, make sure you have enough space in your device before going forward.
</Caution>

**Prerequisites**

## DeploymentDocker


The following documentation will guide you through the installation of an erxes project using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image via Dockerhub that can be used on [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) in order to use erxes. This the guideline will be dedicated to anyone who is about to use erxes for their businesses. If you want to customize or develop additional plugins on erxes, please go to [the developer installation guideline.](/intro)

Docker is an open source platform that allows to develop, ship and run applications by using containers (i.e. packages containing all the parts an application needs to function, such as libraries and dependencies).

# Prerequisites
You will need following things before dive into erxes installation.

- any type of server with **4 core cpu & atleast 8gb ram**
- domain controller's **A record** must pointed to the instance you are going to install erxes on
- ability to connect to your instance via **ssh** protocol
- basic knowledges to **work** on ubuntu operating system such as execute commands in user directory


---

# Installation

**Create an erxes user on the instance**

Assuming you have connected to your instance and ready to execute following steps. First you need to `create erxes user` because all erxes related installation scripts are made for erxes user.
Why?
You don't want to use **root** user to administer your server. So everything will be done by a user called, `erxes`. To accomplish this, run the following command:

```bash
adduser erxes
```
When prompted, enter **unique & strong** password.
(Finish adding the user simply by pressing the `enter` or `return` key through the questions)

Grant adminstrative rights to `erxes` user by following command:

```bash
usermod -aG sudo erxes
```
All prerequisites are completed now you can proceed to installation steps.

# Installation steps

**1.** Create `install.sh` file using text editors such as nano or vim. Then copy the following content into `install.sh`. Following script will install nginx, certbot, docker, docker-compose and nodejs into your server.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
            now=$(date +'%H:%M:%S')
            echo -e "\e[1mStep 1 $now : Updating \e[0m"
        sudo apt-get update -y
        # nginx install
            now=$(date +'%H:%M:%S')
            echo -e "\e[1mStep 2 $now : Installing nginx\e[0m"
        sudo apt install nginx -y
        # docker install
        sudo apt update -y
            now=$(date +'%H:%M:%S')
            echo -e "\e[1mStep 3 $now : Installing docker\e[0m"
        sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y
        curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
        sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"
        apt-cache policy docker-ce
        sudo apt install docker-ce -y
            now=$(date +'%H:%M:%S')
            echo -e "\e[1mStep 4 $now : Installing certbot\e[0m"
        sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
            now=$(date +'%H:%M:%S')
            echo -e "\e[1mStep 5 $now : Installing docker-compose\e[0m"
        sudo apt-get update -y
        sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.27.4/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
        sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
            now=$(date +'%H:%M:%S')
            echo -e "\e[1mStep 6 $now : Installing nodejs\e[0m"
            curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
        #new directory
        sudo apt-get install nodejs -y
            now=$(date +'%H:%M:%S')
            echo -e "\e[1mStep 7 $now : Installing awscli\e[0m"
        sudo apt-get install awscli -y
            now=$(date +'%H:%M:%S')
            echo -e "\e[1mStep 8 $now : Installing npm\e[0m"
        sudo apt install npm -y
            now=$(date +'%H:%M:%S')
            echo -e "\e[1mStep 9 $now : Please enter erxes informations\e[0m"
        sudo npm install -g create-erxes-app -y
            create-erxes-app erxes
```
**2.** Before execute script the use below command to make `install.sh` file executable.
```bash
sudo chmod +x install.sh
```

**3.** Execute `install.sh` file.
```bash
./install.sh
```

**4.** After above steps `logout and relogin` to your server using erxes user. In order to logout from server give following command:
```bash
exit
```
<Note>
you might want to enter command few times if you logged in as root user before.
</Note>

We will use `ssh` protocol to access to server. Use below command:

```bash
ssh erxes@your-ip address-address
```
---

# Starting erxes project
**1.** Below command will trigger erxes installation process.
```bash
create-erxes-app erxes
```
After the execution it will ask your erxes domain name

```bash
https://example.com
```

<Note>
Please use full domain or subdomain names including http socket like below
</Note>
**2.** After the above command `erxes` directory will be created. That includes following files in it `docker-compose.yml, configs.json, package.json, nginx config`. In order to change to `erxes` directory use below command.

```bash
cd /home/erxes/erxes
```
**3.** Change erxes package version of `/home/erxes/erxes/package.json` file to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/erxes" target="_blank">latest</a> version.

```bash
{
  "name": "erxes",
  "private": true,
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "scripts": {
    "erxes": "erxes"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "amqplib": "^0.8.0",
    "create-erxes-app": "0.0.28",
    "dup": "^1.0.0",
    #Change here
    "erxes": "change me",
    "ip": "^1.1.5",
    "up": "^1.0.2"
  }
}
```


**4.** Now you need to initiate docker swarm mode in order to do that use following command.

```bash
docker swarm init
docker network create --driver=overlay --attachable erxes
```
<Note>
In erxes directory we have docker-compose.yml file even with that we do not use `docker-compose up, docker-compose down, docker-compose restart` commands further
</Note>

**5.** Before start application services we need to start `databases`. Following command will start database services.

```bash
npm run erxes deploy-dbs
```
**6.** To check database services up use following command it will shows you all running docker services id, name and state etc.

```bash
docker ps -a | grep mongo
```
wait until all services state become up.
**7.** Now we need to make our mongo have replica set. First we need to enter mongo container then enter mongo instance then execute command following 3 commands will do.
```bash
docker exec -it <mongo container name> bash
mongo -u erxes -p <auto generated password in configs.json>
rs.initiate();
```
<Note>
you may want to hit `return or enter` button few times if we done correctly mongo shell will changes into `"RS0: primary"`
</Note>

To quit mongo instance and container `run exit command` twice.

**8.** Now we need to create `locales` directory in our working directory `/home/erxes/erxes` to do that use following command.

```bash
mkdir locales
```

**9.** Start application services like erxes core uis and gateway services we run following command.
```bash
npm run erxes up -- --uis
```

After this step ui will be downloaded from AWS:s3 so make sure your server can communicate AWS instances without problem


<Note>
Containers are generated one by one, so wait until they finish reading. Meanwhile check for the status using
```bash
docker ps -a
```
To check docker services use
```bash
docker service ls
```
all erxes services needs to be up state
Wait until `gateway` container status becomes healthy also gateway container needs to be start at last.
</Note>

**10.** Now we need to setup our web server first we need to configure our nginx.service for erxes to do that we need to move `nginx.conf` generated by `create-app-erxes erxes` locates in `/home/erxes/erxes` to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`. To do that use following command.

```bash
sudo mv nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/erxes.conf
```
**11.** After that we need to test nginx config. To do that use following command.
```bash
sudo nginx -t
```
If something goes wrong you can replace `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/nginx.conf` to following content

```bash
server {
        server_name example.com;
        index index.html;
        client_max_body_size 50M;
        client_header_buffer_size 32k;

**12.** If nginx test shows successful message we need to restart Nginx. To do that use following command.
    ```bash
    sudo service nginx restart
    ```
**13.** Erxes only works in secure connection to generate free ssl certificate we use `Certbot`. To configure that use following command.

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx
```
<Note>
you have to point your domain's A record to your erxes host machine in order to get certificate without that certbot will not generate certificate order.
</Note>

After entering this command, provide your email and subscription information, and accept the terms. Following that, you will be prompted about the 'redirect' option. We highly recommend enabling this option for security reasons. Once these steps are completed, open your browser and enjoy our product.

# Adding new plugins to erxes
Adding new plugins to erxes is easy task all you need to is add plugin name under `"plugins:"[{}]` in `/home/erxes/erxes/configs.json` file then run `npm run erxes up -- --uis` command. But for some plugins like dashboard does require some `extra` service we will discuss that in another section. Below we have `ideal` configs.json file content that includes every `nessacery configuration lines` for `all plugins`. Please read following contents carefully some lines need some `replacement`.

# Adding dashboard plugin
As we mentioned earlier dashboard plugin requires some extra step to install. First we need to generate `certificate for mongobi` to do that use following commands.

```bash
openssl rand -base64 756 > mongo-key
    sudo chmod 400 mongo-key && sudo chown 999:999 mongo-key
    openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -x509 -days 365 -out certificate.pem --batch
    cat key.pem certificate.pem > mongo.pem
    ```

It will generate mongobi certificate. After we need to add `mongobi` to configs.json file locates in `/home/erxes/erxes/configs.json` like below.

```bash
 "mongo": {
        "username": "erxes",
        "password": "will be generated in configs.json",
    },
    "mongobi:{},
```
At last run `npm run erxes up -- --uis.`

<Note>
Everytime we change configs.json we do `npm run erxes up -- --uis` command to apply change.
</Note>

# Running elasticsearch
If your server is bigger than our required size you can use erxes with elasticsearch. To do that following steps need to be taken.

**1.** Go into /home/erxes/erxes
```bash
cd /home/erxes/erxes
```
**2.** Add following lines to configs.json positions does not matter.
```bash
"essyncer": {},
"elasticsearch" : {},
```
**3.** Then run deploy dbs again with following command.
```bash
npm run erxes deploy-dbs
npm run erxes up -- --uis
```
---

# Removing erxes
**1.** First this is sad but every server need to be tidy following few commands will remove docker stack and dangling containers of swarm.
 ```bash
 docker stack ls
 ```
 will show you stack informations. To leave that use following command.
 ```bash
docker stack rm erxes
 ```

**2.** To remove all dangling containers use following commands.

List and remove all dangling images.

```bash
docker images -f dangling=true
docker rmi $(docker images -q -f dangling=true)
```
List and remove all dangling containers.
```bash
docker ps -a -f status=exited
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q -f status=exited)
```
List and remove all dangling volumes

<Note>
volumes might have data in it so do it with your responsibility
</Note>

```bash
docker volume ls -f dangling=true
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q -f dangling=true)
```
