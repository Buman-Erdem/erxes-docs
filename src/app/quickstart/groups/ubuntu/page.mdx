# Installation on Ubuntu

The following documentation will guide you through the installation of an erxes project using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on [Ubuntu.](https://ubuntu.com/)

Docker is an open platform that allows to develop, ship and run applications by using containers (i.e. packages containing all the parts an application needs to function, such as libraries and dependencies).

# Preparing the installation

erxes installation requires at least four software prerequisites to be already installed on your computer:

<Note>
    Erxes code takes approximately 12GB storage space, make sure you have enough space in your device before going forward.
</Note>

# Prerequisites

- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- [Node.js:](https://nodejs.org/en) only LTS versions are supported (v14 and v16). Other versions of Node.js may not be compatible with the latest release of erxes. The 14.x version is most recommended by erxes. The easier way to install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) is here.
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-install/) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#debian-stable) (latest version) to run the erxes. 
- [Docker](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04) (v20.10.14 and higher) The 20.10.14 version is most recommended by erxes. Docker compose (v2.5.0 and higher)
