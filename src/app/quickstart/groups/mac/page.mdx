# Installation on MacOS

The following documentation will guide you through the installation of an erxes project using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on [MacOs.](https://www.apple.com/macos/sonoma/)

Docker is an open platform that allows to develop, ship and run applications by using containers (i.e. packages containing all the parts an application needs to function, such as libraries and dependencies).

# Preparing the installation
---
erxes installation requires at least four software prerequisites to be already installed on your computer:

<Caution>
    Erxes code takes approximately 12GB storage space, make sure you have enough space in your device before going forward.
</Caution>

# Prerequisites
- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en): only LTS versions are supported (v14 and v16). Other versions of Node.js may not be compatible with the latest release of erxes. The 14.x version is most recommended by erxes. The easier way to install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) is here.
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-install) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#debian-stable) (latest version) to run the erxes.
- [Docker](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04) (v20.10.14 and higher) The 20.10.14 version is most recommended by erxes. Docker compose (v2.5.0 and higher)
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) latest version
- [Xcode](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/install-xcode-command-line-tools/) latest version

## **If your browser don't automatically jump to localhost:3000, you should check logs by using these commands.**

<Tip>
Frequently used pm2 commands on erxes:

- pm2 list - Display all processes status
- pm2 kill - Will remove all processes from pm2 list
- pm2 logs -f - Display all processes logs in streaming (gateway, plugin-name etc.)
- pm2 restart all - Restart all processes
