# Introduction to power-ups

As a SaaS user, you’ll have limited usage of some plugins available for our free plan, then you can increase your usage for each plugin depending on your needs with power-ups.
Benefits of having power-ups, you’ll power up your usage according to your needs rather than having paid junk of plugins you need, which comes within the package.
