# Introduction to add-ons
Add-ons are the sub-features/integrations that can work with plugins to enhance the experience of plugins.

All plugins and add-ons are available on [our marketplace](https://erxes.io/marketplace) for you to learn and install after you’ve finished installing erxes XOS if you’re on the self-hosted version or you’ll have it already if you're on our SaaS version.
